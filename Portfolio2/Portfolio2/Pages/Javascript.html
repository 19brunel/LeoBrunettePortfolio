            <p>The JavaScript activity introduced three new languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some presented to be much more complicated than others. The first language we used was HTML, the building block language for all websites. This is the language my group and I found the easiest, as everyone had previously worked with it in some fashion. The next language was CSS, this proved to be a little more difficult especially when we were given a brand new resource to me: Bootstrap. I had previous experience with normal CSS from within a style tag embed in the head of the HTML document. However Bootstrap is an outside resource which we imported to be used in our project. Bootstrap is a resource that allows for more fluid and optimized organization for a webpage. This presented some difficulty as I had little prior experience with external resources. The syntax for using Bootstrap was unfamiliar to me but easy to pick up. The most difficult for our group was JavaScript. JavaScript is a different language from all other languages we were currently familiar with. It is a function based language rather than a class based language like Java and C#. This, along with a new syntax proved to be difficult for our group, however thanks to Vue, an open source JavaScript Framework which easily allowed for us to work with user input and organize our information and functions. My group's biggest difficulty during this activity was the JavaScript. It’s new syntax and style gave it a little steeper learning curve, but we were able to figure it out as group by working together and asking each other questions.</p>
