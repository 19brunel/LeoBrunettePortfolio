            <p>When my group was given the File IO activity we first approached it by planning. We did this by looking at the specific tasks the activity required to be completed. We had a team of six and there were eight different tasks or parts to finish the File IO activity. My group first decided to find certain tasks that could be grouped together and would take a similar amount of time to finish as the ungrouped tasks. With a group of eight, two members would have to complete two tasks instead of one. We grouped the tasks: displaying the whole list and displaying the sum of the entire list, and then displaying the even numbers of the list and displaying the odd numbers of the list. Everyone picked what they wanted to work on. I wanted to work on the Data File. I first chose this with the understanding that this meant not only creating a data file with integers in it on seperate lines but also generating a way for that file to be used by the rest of my group in their methods. This was not completely agreed upon by my group at the beginning of work on the project and is something to keep in mind for further projects. As a group we have to have a clear understanding and definition for what each task is and what we want that task to accomplish. Understanding the use of my method was undefined unfortunately, and it wasted some time of my teammates in the form of misdirected research. My team had the understanding that they were each responsible for using the string provided by a previous teammates method and would have to determine the location of the data file and how to convert it into an array or list for them to be able to use for their computations. My understanding, which in the end saved time for my team and complexity of the software was that it was my job to take the file and determine its location and turn it into a primitive data type that my team could easily access and manipulate to make their computations. It was after working for a short time, that we as a team, made the decision for me to pursue this and decided on a data type of List&lt;int&gt; which I would create to be passed to all of their methods. This allowed for them to focus on the computations rather than the inputing the file. I chose this task with the thinking that I would have to take the file input and output it as a primitive data type for my team to use. I believed it to be a greater challenge than the other tasks and would allow me to learn more unknown content. With this planning I believe that my team was able to efficiently use our time for the first project and complete it in a timely manner.</p>
            <p>This project was a good introduction into the both source control and C#. The source control software we used was GitHub and GitKraken to allow for us to work in an efficient manner together. Both of these can be daunting, but there are ways, which we learned through this activity, that can help to make source control simpler and less confusing. We did this by simply breaking down each of our tasks into separate class definitions, that way we could just simply create a new instance of each other’s classes and call the methods using the class definition. By making our tasks in separate class definitions merging our branches was much easier because there wasn’t any merge conflicts as they were separate classes and no one was editing each others class. Without merge conflicts, merging, one of the most difficult parts of source control, became simple. This activity also gave a glimpse into C#, a language we are going to use further in our Full Stack development. It introduced us to the similar, but slightly different syntax from Java, another hard coded language that all of my team is very familiar with. It also introduced me to File IO in C# which is going to be important in Full Stack development. That is why this activity was a valuable first activity as a team and will allow for us to be efficient as we continue our learning.</p>
            <p>The primary difficulty I faced along with my team was communication. As I described earlier, my team early into the project faced some difficulty with communication and it had some consequences we had to fix. These problems were not to much of an issue for our team during this project but could have been much larger if this was a more complicated project. We were able to solve this issue with simply talking. Talking about what our tasks were and how they were to be incorporated together solved our issues. This is something we now know is important to do in the initial planning of the project. </p>
